; Enable automated transmissions and the "repeat" functionality.
; Optionally you can disable the repeater from transmitting althoughter and thus not "repeating" any communications received.

; Repeater operation mode
; 'simplex-vox' = Simplex Mode - Voice Operated (auto-record and then transmit when it "hears" mic input on the USB sound card.)
; 'simplex-cor' = Simplex Mode - Carrier Operated Relay/Switch (record and then transmit when the COR/COS GPIO pin is ON (aka. "high")
